                <h3>Site now uses IAM Roles & OIDC to run GitHub Actions &#128640</h3>
                <p>
                    In the previous blog (Future Improvements section), I recognised that a security issue existed within my website implementation. Long-lived credentials, in the form of access keys and secret access keys were attached to IAM users. 
                    These creds were used to handle calls to STS (AWS Security Token Service). STS generated and passed short-lived access tokens to GitHub Actions, which in turn were used by GitHub Actions workflows to use AWS services every time the workflow was triggered.
                    I was happy that the IAM policies I had written earlier were good for reuse, as they allow access only to services required by the GitHub Actions workflows (least-privileged principle). 
                    What was not security best-practice was attaching the IAM policies to IAM users as inline policies, when using Roles is AWS recommended practice.
                    Not using Roles was however, only the minor part of the problem. The main crux of the matter is the long-lived access keys. 
                    Even though the keys were encrypted in GitHub as Actions Secrets and accessed in the GitHub Actions workflow code using environment variables, the Access Keys and Secret Access Keys, if leaked, could provide a long-term access method into my AWS account. For this reason, they had to go!
                    Here, I will dive into the details of the conversion to using Roles with OIDC (OpenID Connect) and some GitHub-related growing pains.

                <p>
                    As a starting assumption, I thought I'd need to setup an IdP (Identity Provider) using a service such as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html" target="_blank">Cognito Identity Pools</a>. This is untrue, although performing a service to generate temporary AWS credentials, Cognito Identity pools is aimed more at granting human users with temporary access credentils.
                    I did some digging and came across this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-iam-roles-to-connect-github-actions-to-actions-in-aws/" target="_blank">Security Blog by David Rowe</a> which got me started. I realised two things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I didn't need to run an Identity Pool, as I needed was an IAM Identity Provider and a few connection details provided in the blog. Great!</li>
                        <li>Although not overly stressed in the blog, I soon realised I would need to create a GitHub Organization, something I'd hadn't needed to date. All my repos are stored in a personal account, but the addition of an Organization is a mandated field within the IAM Identity Provider options.</li>
                    </ul>
